  <p id="tribute-info">As Naruto was born, his home village of Konoha came under attack by a nine-tailed fox demon which was sealed in him at infancy to protect the people of the village. Due to this fact he became distrusted and resented by the people around him during his childhood. He, however, aspires to become the Hokage; a title given to the leader of Hidden Leaf Village, and as the most poorly performing student in his ninja school, he strives to prove his worth to his peers and fellow villagers. He is known for his often-used catchphrase "Dattebayo", and is connected to most other characters around him by either friendship or rivalry.
  <br/><br/>
  At the end of the series, Naruto marries Hinata Hyuga, and has two children, daughter Himawari and son Boruto. He also becomes the Seventh Hokage, finally fulfilling his dream.
          </p>
  
  <h2>Personality</h2>
  
  <p>Naruto is generally a very simple minded, easy going, cheerful person. He often rushes things, and misses obvious things such as Hinata's constant shyness around him.
  <br/><br/>
  In the beginning of the series, Naruto is very fun loving, often pulling pranks on fellow villagers. This usually ends in a scolding from Iruka Umino. Naruto later reveals he did these pranks because he liked the attention, as he grew up with no parents or friends. He's also very beginning when he's young, despite being largely unskilled in comparison to his peers.
  <br/><br/>
  As the series progresses and Naruto gets older, he eventually starts to become more serious and wises up.
  <br/><br/>
  As a JinchÅ«riki bearing the Nine Tailed Fox, Kurama, Naruto was often jeered at and avoided by most villagers. Because of this, Naruto was largely alone in the early parts of his life, and would often seek out attention by pulling pranks. This would become Naruto's main reason want to become Hokage, so everyone in the village would acknowledge and respect him. Eventually, Naruto's actions towards saving the village (And even the whole world) lead to many villagers respecting and even admiring him. In the movie, Naruto: The Last, Naruto has fans who come from all different villages just to see him.
  <br/><br/>
  Naruto has a strong dedication to his friends, often willing to put his life on the line to protect them. Despite his treachery towards the Hidden Leaf Village, Naruto has always considered childhood rival Sasuke Uchiha to be his best friend. In the end of the series, Naruto reveals that he cared for Sasuke so much because he felt they knew the same pain of being alone, and he constantly would chase after him because Naruto did not want to see him hurt when there is no need to.
  <br/><br/>
  As Hokage, Naruto seems to have grown even more mature. When Boruto was pulling pranks, Naruto knew this was because he didn't have a father figure, and spent time with him. This shows that Naruto cares deeply for his children.</p>
  
  <h2>Powers and abilities</h2>
  
  <p>Initially, Naruto is largely unskilled in all types of jutsu, especially in comparison to his peers. His failure of the cloning technique led him to eventually learning the Shadow Clone Jutsu, which is considered to be a Jonin level technique. This move is one of his signature moves, and one he uses commonly through the whole series.
  <br/><br/>
  He eventually learns a technique his father invented through Jiraiya called Rasengan. This technique is a visible concentrated ball of chakra that fits in the users hand, capable of dealing very destructive power. This technique also becomes one of Naruto's signature moves, and one he even expands upon, such as with his Rasenshuriken.
  <br/><br/>
  Since Naruto has the Nine Tails Fox sealed inside him, he is able to use the Fox's chakra, which is much greater than the average human. Initially Naruto and the Fox hated each other, and would rarely grant Naruto his power unless they were going to die. Eventually, they become friends, and Naruto then refers to the fox by his name, Kurama. At this point, Naruto can use Kurama's chakra at will.
  <br/><br/>
  Naruto also learned to access a state called Sage mode. While in this mode, Naruto's senses are greatly enhanced.
